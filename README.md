======================

DITA-OT plugins to convert our XML collective agreements  to DITA-XML.

## Introduction

Our collective agreements are bilingual documentation, side by side. We developped in the past a custom EDD (agreement.edd) in Adobe Framemaker 9, that we exported as a DTD (agreement.dtd) to fullfil the need of our clients. 

Later, when we started to use DITA XML, the need of a tool to export one format to the other was required.
